# ocp.project

A repository of reusable definitions, modules, templates, boilerplate and
utilities for software development projects.

Eventually this repo will contain:

- [`Dockerfile` definitions](src/docker) for CI/CD toolchains, IaC provisioning, application workloads, etc.
- [Boilerplate definitions](src/boilerplate) for provisioning new files, modules and projects.
- CI/CD workflows for scanning, integrating and deploying containerized workloads.
- Reusable and 'higher-order' [Terraform modules](src/tf/modules).
- Patterns for implementing local developer environments.
- Various utility [scripts](src/scripts).

And whatever additional bits and pieces we find useful throughout our various
toolchains.
